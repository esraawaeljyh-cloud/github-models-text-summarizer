Original Paragraph:


Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems
that learn from data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems identify
patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning is widely
used in applications such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, and image recognition.
